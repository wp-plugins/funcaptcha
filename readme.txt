Stop spam with a fun, fast mini-game CAPTCHA! FunCaptcha is free, and works on every desktop and mobile device. For WP, BuddyPress, CF7.

== Description ==

Spammers abuse your site, but users hate typing out twisty letters or ad phrases (aka CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA). Automated spam filters make mistakes and require constant checking. FunCaptcha presents a mini-game CAPTCHA that blocks the bots while giving your users a few moments of fun. It's a real security solution hardened by experts and automatically updated to provide the best protection. Try [a demo](https://swipeads.co/) on our site!

Users complete these little games faster than other CAPTCHAs, with fewer frustrating failures and no typing. They work on all browsers and mobile devices, using HTML5 with a fallback to Flash. Visually impaired users can complete an audio challenge CAPTCHA provided by reCAPTCHA.

The FunCaptcha widget works easily on registration and comment forms, as well as Contact Form 7. You can keep your anti-spam solutions such as Akismet, though you won't need to check those filters as often.

If you get in on the ground floor now, you can be first in line to start earning money with upcoming FunCaptchas that integrate advertising with the fun, fast CAPTCHA games you see now. They will require no typing or extra time, and remain as secure as ever.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I try it out? =
Try [a demo](https://swipeads.co/) of FunCaptcha on our site.

= Does FunCaptcha work on mobile and all other platforms? =
Yes. It is built on HTML5, with full support for mobiles. It works great with touch interfaces, and does not require any typing. All platforms used by a site’s customers are supported, including every kind of PC and Mac. A Flash version seamlessly appears for older browsers. In short, no user will be blocked.

= Is there audio accessibility? =
Yes. We use the well-known “reCAPTCHA” service to provide an audio CAPTCHA for those who need it.

= Are other CAPTCHAs more secure? =
Unfortunately, all typed-in CAPTCHAs are now being solved by bots to some degree. Some newer CAPTCHA alternatives are actually much easier for bots to solve than before! Once these new alternatives become popular enough to be worthwhile for hackers to target, they will crumble. FunCaptcha will stay ahead of the curve, and clearly explain how we do it-- not resort to a black box of promises.

= FunCaptcha does not appear for me =
We have noticed a few of our users are using the JetPack plugin, which currently does not support third party CAPTCHAs. You can disable the JetPack comment addon from your dashboard and it will work fine.

= FunCaptcha shows an error message =
This error message will only appear if you have not correctly added your private and public keys to the settings panel in your wordpress admin dashboard.
